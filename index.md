=================

Hello, World! I'm Alyssa, a hacker interested in computer vision,
networking, and security among other fields. I like minimalist design,
visible in both my code and the my website design, and I admire the UNIX
philosophy. Offline, I love spending time with my German Shepherd,
Apollo!
